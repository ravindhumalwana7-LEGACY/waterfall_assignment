## Problem statement
Manually allocating hostel rooms is inefficient, time consuming and has high chance for human errors.

One of the biggest problem is data redundancy. Data redundancy leads to overbooking or underutiliazing space in hostel rooms. Inwhich the oppourtunity for a student to suitable accommodation is lost.

Another problem is administrative staff could spend excessive amount of time to cater student preferences. 

Also another problem is lack of real time update and access for students to check their room allocation.
