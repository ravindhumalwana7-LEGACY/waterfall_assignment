# Phrase 1:Planning
## Problem statement
Manually allocating hostel rooms is inefficient, time consuming and has high chance for human errors.

One of the biggest problem is data redundancy. Data redundancy leads to overbooking or underutiliazing space in hostel rooms. Inwhich the oppourtunity for a student to suitable accommodation is lost.

Another problem is administrative staff could spend excessive amount of time to cater student preferences. 

Also lack of real time update and access for students to check their room allocation. Without real time visibility into room status the administration struggles to manage student intake. Students also face unnecessary delays and uncertainity during the entrollment process.



## Objective
### 1. Automate allocation
Replacing the manual processes with an automated system that assigns rooms vased on student criteria.

### 2. Completely eliminate redundancy
 
Implementation of a relational database management system and create a single database to prevent double booking and ensure all accomodations are accounted for.

### 3. Automated notifications

Send emails to the students when they successfully register for hostel accomodations and when a room is successfully allocated. Also notify whether the student is eligible for hostel facilities according to university regulations and rules.
